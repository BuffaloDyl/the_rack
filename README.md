# The Rack
Manually add extra hops to your lightning network payments

# What is the Rack?
The Rack is a privacy tool for the lightning network. On the lightning network, payments pass through routing nodes called "hops." Each hop adds additional privacy to your payment, but each one also adds more latency and raises the likelihood of a payment failure. Many lightning wallets focus on ensuring payments are fast and reliable, so they optimize payments to use as few hops as possible, which harms user privacy. The Rack lets you turn that around by using the excellent lnproxy network to manually add extra hops to your payments.
